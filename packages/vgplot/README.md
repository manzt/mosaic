# vgplot

A Mosaic-backed visualization grammar for creating interactive dashboards and linked views, combining plots, inputs, and layouts.

This package provides a JavaScript API for creating visualizations and dashboards. See the [mosaic-spec](https://github.com/uwdata/mosaic/tree/main/packages/mosaic-spec) package to instead use declarative specifications in JSON or YAML format.
